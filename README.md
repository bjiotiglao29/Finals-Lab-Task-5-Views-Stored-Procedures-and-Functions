# Finals-Lab-Task-5-Views-Stored-Procedures-and-Functions
- This portfolio demonstrates the use of SQL views, stored procedures, and stored functions to manage and manipulate database data. It covers tasks such as filtering data with views, updating records with stored procedures, and retrieving data using functions.

# 1.Setup MySQL Workbench:
- Open XAMPP and start the MySQL server.
- Connect MySQL Workbench to the server.
- Execute practice queries using the democodes.sql file.
# 2.Use Inventory Database:
- Open the inventory.sql file to begin the tasks.
# 3.Create Views:
- View to display vendor info and products with in-date from 2002 onward.
- View for products priced between 100–150.
- View to compute total price for products sold by specific vendors.
# 4.Create Stored Procedure:
- Procedure to update vendor name from 'Bryson, Inc.' to 'Bryson and Co'.
# 5.Create Function:
- Function that takes vendor code and state to display product details.
# 6.Execute and Document:
- Run the SQL and capture screenshots of commands and results.
